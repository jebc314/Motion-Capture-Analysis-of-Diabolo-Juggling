# Motion-Capture-Analysis-of-Diabolo-Juggling
This project analyzes data from the motion capture of diabolo (Chinese yoyo) performances. This builds on the current state-of-the-art diabolo motion predictors using improved analytical models and machine learning.

I carried out this research in TJHSST's Computer Systems Lab under the guidance of Dr. Gabor.
